# EcommerceHub: Enterprise Multi-Vendor Platform

![JaCoCo Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-JaCoCo%20report-blue)
![CI](https://github.com/FILIPIOAN10/e-commerce-app/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A full-stack, multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace with separate portals for **admin**, **seller**, and **customer** users. Built with **Spring Boot** and **React**, it covers product catalog, order management, payments, AI-powered search, recommendations, and real-time inventory.

The stack is containerized with **Docker Compose** and uses **PostgreSQL + pgvector**, **Redis**, and **HashiCorp Vault** for data, caching, and secrets.

## What it does

- **Multi-role marketplace** — admin, seller, and customer portals with role-based access control.
- **Product & inventory** — product management, categories, low-stock alerts, image galleries, and recently viewed tracking.
- **Cart & checkout** — stackable coupons, shipping cost estimation, guest checkout, cart save-for-later, and Stripe payments.
- **AI search & recommendations** — natural language product search and "Recommended for You" / "Similar Products" powered by OpenAI embeddings and pgvector.
- **Security** — JWT authentication, OAuth2 (GitHub, Google), TOTP 2FA with purpose-scoped challenge tokens, CSRF protection, and Vault-backed secrets.
- **Observability & scale** — Redis caching, rate limiting, audit logging, Flyway migrations, and JaCoCo test coverage.

## Getting Started
 
### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
 
### Backend & Infrastructure
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FILIPIOAN10/e-commerce-app.git
cd e-commerce-app
 
# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your secrets (JWT_SECRET, OPENAI_API_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, etc.)
 
# Start all services
docker compose up --build
```

`docker-compose.yml` contains **no secrets**. Every credential is read from the
git-ignored `.env`, forwarded into HashiCorp Vault by `scripts/vault-init.sh`, and
resolved by Spring Cloud Vault at startup. Required variables have no fallback
defaults, so Compose fails fast with a clear message if one is missing.

### Database migrations

The schema is owned by **Flyway**, not by Hibernate. Migrations live in
`ecom-backend/src/main/resources/db/migration` and run automatically on startup:

| Migration | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `V1__baseline_schema.sql` | Full schema: 17 tables, FKs, unique constraints, indexes |
| `V2__seed_roles_and_users.sql` | Roles and demo users (replaces the old `data.sql`) |

Hibernate runs with `ddl-auto=validate`, so the application refuses to start if an
entity ever drifts out of sync with the schema.

To add a change, create a new file — never edit an applied one:

```bash
# ecom-backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__add_product_sku.sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN sku VARCHAR(64);
```

An existing database created by the previous `ddl-auto=update` setup is adopted
automatically: `baseline-on-migrate` stamps it at version 1 and continues from V2,
so no data is lost. To rebuild from scratch:

```bash
docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build
```

Inspect applied migrations at any time:

```bash
docker exec -it ecommerce-postgres psql -U postgres -d ecommerce \
  -c "SELECT version, description, success FROM flyway_schema_history ORDER BY installed_rank;"
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd ecom-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app is served at `http://localhost:5173`, the API at `http://localhost:8080`,
and Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

### Demo accounts

| Username | Password | Roles |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `adminPass` | USER, SELLER, ADMIN |
| `user1` | `password1` | USER |
| `seller1` | `password2` | SELLER |

### Test Coverage (JaCoCo)

```bash
# Run tests and generate coverage report:
cd ecom-backend && ./mvnw test
# Open the HTML report:
# target/site/jacoco/index.html
# The verify phase enforces >= 60% line coverage on the service layer:
./mvnw verify
```

<!-- CI trigger test - 2026-08-12 -->
